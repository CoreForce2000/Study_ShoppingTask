- Change the topbar when in the cart
•	Whenever participants open a tile or look into their trolley, the timer should pause. 
- Fix timer lag when image loading issue 
- Fix image loading speed online
	If time is up, then phase 1 ends. There is a slide that needs to be shown. 
	If the budget is exhausted before the end of phase 1, then participants will be given additional money . I think I provided a slide for this too. 
•	In progress - Time should NO be minus. Time should be up after 15 minutes. We have to check if we 
    introduce a rule that the items in the trolley need to reach a certain number, and only if this 
    number has been reached, participants should not be given more time. If we allow more time, 
    we need to explain this to participants, so I need another introduction slide, but the timer cannot 
    be minus. It is not clear what this means. 

Bugs:
- Investigate sorting issue: Cocaine listed twice in two appending lines 
- Investigate why proseccos first selection disappears after click

Check:
•	What happened to the price lists? Why are now prices picked up. Could you please check that items have prices and that these prices are picked up?

Nice-to-Have:
•	If ID number had been used previously, there should be a warning if an additional file should be written (previously data should not be overwritten)


Note:
•	In progress - Pipers is not spelt correctly. It should be: Pipes – which is a category that you have. So please delete Pipers. 
--> Solution was in the lists containing drugs of different categories. Those are not in synch with the rest of the categories (not ideal)
