•	It does not make sense if “none of these” is ticked that other drugs are ticked as well. If none of these is ticked, then other options should be disabled. 
•	When ‘other ‘ is ticked – then the VAS should not appear. The question: How much do you want to use other right now? Does not make sense. 

Align the shop design with the design spec
•	Why is the button Add to trolley larger than the Back button? There is no rationale for this. They should be the same size. 
•	Could we please get rid of the underlining of the category names when the category had been opened. 
•	The trolley button is not working. It is not possible to open the trolley. 
•	Would it be possible to have a count of items in the trolley next to the trolley icon. 
•	In progress - Please put a trolley symbol in the right corner, you can also count the items in trolley, so that all three locations of the header (budget, timer, trolley) are changing over time.
